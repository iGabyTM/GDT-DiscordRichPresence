## About
If you would like to support [GDT](https://discordbots.org/bot/568126389061025807), you can do it by using [this](/iGabyTM/GDT-DiscordRichPresence/blob/master/README.md#configin) configuration for [EasyRP](https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP/releases) by [@Pizzabelly](https://github.com/Pizzabelly)
Once you have setup the settings, all you have to do is to run the `easyrp.exe` and to select the program as `Game Activity` on discord settings.
